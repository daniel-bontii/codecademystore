# Codecademy Store Project

This project builds a program that mimics Codecademyâ€™s own online store with Redux! The application should display products from the Codecademy store and allow the user to add them to their cart. In the cart, the user can adjust the quantity of each item and the running total will be displayed at the bottom. Lastly, the user can choose the currency for the entire application.

## Scope

Core Redux API
